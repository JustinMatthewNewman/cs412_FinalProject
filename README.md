- Define the format of inputs:
    - First line is an integer indicating the maximum weight.
    - Second line is an integer n indicating how many items are in the bag.
    - Next n lines of input indicate each item in the bag. Each line can be broken into three parts
      separated by a space; item name, item value, item weight.
