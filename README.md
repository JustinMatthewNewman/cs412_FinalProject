# cs412_FinalProject
Final Project for cs412 JMU

- Clearly define the problem.
     Can a value of at least V be achieved without exceeding the weight W?
     
- Clearly define tasks.

- Define the format of inputs:
    - First line is an integer indicating the maximum weight.
    - Second line is an integer n indicating how many items are in the bag.
    - Next n lines of input indicate each item in the bag. Each line can be broken into three parts
      separated by a space; item name, item value, item weight.

- Define the format of the output:
    - First x lines of output print each item used in the final solution.
    - Next x + 1 line prints the total value of the solution.
    - Next x + 2 line prints the total weight of the solution.
    - Next x + 3 line prints the total time taken to get the solution.
